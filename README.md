# Good-Seed---Age-Verification-for-Alcohol-Sales
This project focuses on using data science to help the supermarket chain Good Seed ensure compliance with alcohol laws by preventing underage alcohol sales. The task is to build a computer vision model to estimate the age of customers purchasing alcohol based on their photos.

Project Description
The supermarket chain Good Seed would like to explore whether data science can help them comply with alcohol laws by ensuring they don’t sell alcohol to underage individuals. They ask you to evaluate this possibility, so when you start working, keep the following in mind:

The stores are equipped with cameras in the checkout area that activate when a person is purchasing alcohol.
Computer vision methods can be used to estimate a person’s age from a photo.
The task, then, is to build and evaluate a model to verify the age of individuals.
To begin working on the task, you will have a dataset of people’s photos with their indicated ages.
Project Instructions

Complete a questionnaire to verify your understanding of the project description.
Perform exploratory data analysis to get a general overview of the dataset.
Train and evaluate the model (this must be done on the GPU platform).
Combine your code, output, and findings (from the previous points) into the final Jupyter notebook.
Draw conclusions from the model evaluation and add them to the notebook.
Project reviewers will review your final notebook.
